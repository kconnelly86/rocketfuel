            <h3>Facts About Stars </h3>
            <p class="top-info"> Stars are luminous spheres made of plasma – a superheated gas threaded with a magnetic field. They are made mostly of hydrogen,which stars fuse in their cores. That process releases energy, which pushes against the weight of the outer layers of the star and keeps it stable.</p>

            <h3>How Stars Form And Die</h3>
            <p class="top-info"> Star formation happens in clouds of interstellar gas and dust called “nebulae”. These clouds are mostly molecular hydrogen, and are often referred to as HII regions. The process begins when the cloud is nudged into a spinning motion, perhaps by a shock wave from a nearby supernova explosion. Clumps begin to form, and they get hotter and hotter as they gain more mass. When the temperature inside such a “young stellar object” reaches 10 million degrees Celsius, a process called “nuclear fusion” ignites, and a star is born. Star birth can take millions of years and create families of stars. Astronomers see examplesof star formation in nebulae throughout our own Milky Way Galaxy and in many other galaxies. The most famous and closest stellar nursery to Earth is the Orion Nebula, which lies about 1,500 light-years away and is visible to observers from November through April each year.

            <h3>Types Of Stars</h3>
            <p class="top-info"> Astronomers sort stars into categories according to their spectral characteristics – that is the information contained in
            the light they radiate. The general categories are O, B, A, F, G, K, M, R, N, T, Y, and group stars (and stellar objects)
            by their temperatures, luminosities, and colors. For example, O- and B-type stars are blue-looking and are generally among
            the hottest stars – between 30-40,000 Kelvin. A-type stars are blue-white and have temperatures around 9,500 K. The F-type
            stars are white and are no hotter than 7,500 K. The G-type stars are yellow-white and around 5,900-6,000 K. At the cooler
            end of the spectrum, the K and M stars are orange and red, respectively, and range from 5,300 to 3,800 degrees Kelvin. The
            coolest stellar objects are the R, N, T, and Y stars, which include the brown dwarfs (objects too hot to be planets and too
            cool to be stars).

               There are 9,096 stars visible to the naked eye in the entire sky. To see more, you have to use a telescope to reveal stars fainter than your eyes can see. You can only see about 2,000 stars on a very dark night with the naked eye from any given place on Earth. To do this, you need to observe on a moonless night and be far away from sources of light pollution. Astronomers estimate there are a trillion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Stars are born in batches in their stellar nurseries. Over time, they travel through the Milky Way, far from their crèches. Most stars travel the galaxy with companions or in clusters. But not all stars do that; our Sun, for example, moves through the galaxy without a stellar companion. When you look at a star (or any object in space) you are seeing how it looked in the past. The Sun appears as it was 8.5 minutes ago. The view of Alpha Centauri is 4.3 years old, while the appearance of Sirius is more than 8 years old. The more massive a star, the shorter its lifespan. A very massive star may live only tens of millions of years, while a cool dwarf will shine on for billions of years. At an age of about 4.5 billion years, our Sun is considered middle-aged. The oldest accurately dated star chart appeared in ancient Egyptian astronomy in 1534 BC. In 185 AD Chinese astronomers were the first to record a supernova, this is now classified as SN 185. The furthest distance an individual star has been observed from is about 100 million light years from the Earth in the M100 galaxy of the Virgo Cluster.

                <article>Stars may “live” longer than humans do – ranging from tens of millions to billions of years – but eventually, they, too, come to the ends of their lives. The manner of a star’s death depends on the mass it had after it finished forming. Stars with masses similar to the Sun die much differently from stars that have 7 or more solar masses. Yet, the process of star death starts out the same for all stars: they run out of fuel. For much of its life, a star fuses hydrogen to make helium. When that runs out, then the star fuses helium, and then carbon. Each level of fusion releases more energy, which heats up the star. In sun-like stars, the increased heating causes them to swell up to become giant stars. Any nearby planets are enveloped by the expanding star. Eventually the outer stellar atmosphere blows away, creating an expanding cloud of gas around the star. This is called a “planetary nebula”. What’s left of the star itself slowly shrinks and cools. Eventually, the dying star becomes a white dwarf. Stars that are much more massive than the Sun continue the fusion process until they reach a point where the core collapses. The outer layers also collapse onto the core and then rebound out to space catastrophic
                explosion called a supernova. When stars die, all the elements they created in their cores are scattered to space, to become part of interstellar clouds of gas and dust. Those chemical elements are seed materials for new generations of stars, planets,and life.

                <article>Astronomers further classify stars by such characteristics as their rotation rates, and metallicity (how many elements heavier than hydrogen and helium they contain). In addition, they use some other specific information about their luminosity or the existence of exotic chemical elements in the star’s atmosphere. Stars are plotted on a color-luminosity chart called the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. The stars in their hydrogen-burning phase fall into a curving line called the Main Sequence. White dwarfs, giants, and supergiants all fall outside this sequence, showing that they are fusing other elements and thus are in advanced stages of evolution.
